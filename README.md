## Problem text

Alice is a kindergarten teacher. She wants to give some candies to
the children in her class.  All the children sit in a line (their
positions are fixed), and each  of them has a rating score according
to his or her performance in the class.  Alice wants to give at
least 1 candy to each child. If two children sit next to each other,
then the one with the higher rating must get more candies. Alice
wants to save money, so she needs to minimize the total number of
candies given to the children.
